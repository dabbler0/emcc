        About EMC<sup>2</sup>
      </div>
      <div class="content_body">
        <p>The Exeter Math Club Competition (EMC2) is a middle-school math 
        competition held at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire. 
        EMC2 is an excellent opportunity for young aspiring mathematicians to 
        develop their mathematical talents, get tournament experience, bond with 
        their friends, and connect with other students from different schools. The 
        tournament is being run mostly by Exeter Math Club students, but with 
        some help from our teachers. Most of us have participated in math contests 
        in middle school and all of us participate in high school contests, and 
        we've tried to incorporate some of our favorite parts of those competitions 
        into EMC2.</p>

        <p>The tournament consists of two individual rounds (speed and accuracy), a 
        team round, and a "guts" round. Students are given 20 minutes to solve 20 
        questions in the first round and 30 minutes for 10 questions in the second 
        round. The team round is a 45 minute round in which all four team 
        members work together to solve 10 questions. The guts round is a fun and 
        exciting addition to regular written rounds. It is a fast-paced, hour-long 
        team round where 24 problems are given in sets of three, one set at a time 
        for the team to solve together. Teams may spend as much time as they like 
        on each set, and can submit the set to a grader whenever they wish to 
        receive a new set of problems. Teams may not return to a set after having 
        submitted it, as grading occurs immediately after a team has turned in a set 
        of problems. For additional information about the tournamentâ€™s format, 
        please click here. Make a hyper link thing here?
        Teams should consist of 4 students in the 8th grade or below, with one 
        coach or other chaperone per team. Teams representing a single school 
        should not have students from outside that school. Each school may now 
        enter as many teams as they wish. Individual students or aggregate teams 
        can also enter, and we will sort them into teams of four ourselves. The cost 
        for a full team is $50, and $15 for individual entries. </p>

        <p>EMC<sup>2</sup> to traveling teams from outside the local region; as a result, last
        year we had over 180 students, with teams from far-flung places including 
        China and Illinois and the numbers keep increasing. This year too, we're 
        looking to keep the competition open for any teams willing to travel. 
        Teams would be able to leave for home Saturday afternoon by 4:00 (we 
        have finished on or ahead of schedule in past years), and we will work to 
        provide transportation to the airport if needed.) For additional information 
        regarding travel information, click here.</p>
